Effect of Cooling Velocity on Battery Temperature


Overview

This project investigates the effect of cooling velocity on the thermal performance of a lithium-ion battery pack. Using simulations in ANSYS, we analyze how varying airflow velocities influence temperature distribution and cooling efficiency in Battery Thermal Management Systems (BTMS). The study aims to optimize BTMS for improved heat dissipation and energy efficiency
